# autism_speech_task

This project presents a prototype web-based interactive platform that integrates textual prompts and AI-generated videos to engage users in speech tasks, with a focus on accessible interaction for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

## Contents

- `videos/`: AI-generated videos created from prompt texts using a text-to-video model.
- `autism_intervention_prompts.txt`: Intervention prompts tailored for speech development in children with autism.
- `prompts_en.txt`: General English prompts used in speech tasks.
- `prompts_en_xiaobai.txt`: English prompts with name Xiaobai.
- `index.html`: Main webpage for launching the interactive task interface.

## Website

This GitHub repository serves as the backend and frontend for a website-based interface. The `index.html` file launches the interactive task system in a browser.

## Video Generation

The `videos/` folder contains synthetic videos generated from the text prompts in this repository. These are created using the [Wan2.1 T2V-1.3B](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1) modelâ€”a state-of-the-art text-to-video framework. Each video corresponds to a specific prompt and is designed to provide engaging visual context for children during speech practice.
